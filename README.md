# DSAND Project 1 -  Unscramble Computer Science Problems

This repository is part of the Udacity [Data Structures & Algorithms Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-nanodegree--nd256).

This project has 4 tasks to be completed.

1. Implement an algorithm for each task.
2. It should only print what the instructions require.
3. Each task should be analyzed to determine the worst case time complexity of Big O.

In this project, we are not concerned with optimizing the code.  Rather, the task is to analysis the implementation's time complexity.

In the `analysis` folder, I included a more detailed analysis including estimated time to execute the worst case.

## Time Complexity Resources

The following documents were used for the time complexity analyzes:

* Python - [TimeComplexity](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity)
* [Complexity of Python Operations](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~pattis/ICS-33/lectures/complexitypython.txt)
